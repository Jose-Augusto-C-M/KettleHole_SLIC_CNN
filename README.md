# KettleHole_SLIC_CNN
Codes used for the segmentation of Kettle Holles plant species using SLIC combined with a CNN approach

For using the transferlearning developed in the research in another project, follow the steps:

Download the file H5 Xception to a local folder, thatÂ´s the trained weights of the model.

Load the images in to the same folder and put the JM_main_segcc.ipynb algorithm to do the segmentation and transfer learning, in some time you should get your result.

If you need to train new models the code used is present in Main.py .
